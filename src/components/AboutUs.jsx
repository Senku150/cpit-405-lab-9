                Welcome to my Recipe Finder app! This application allows you to search for a wide variety of recipes
                using the Spoonacular API.

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                We fetches recipes from the Spoonacular API, which provides a large database of recipes and food information.
                You can search for recipes based on ingredients. Simply enter your ingredients and the app will show you a list of recipes that match.
            </p>
